## Overview

This project is a Face Recognition Attendance System implemented using Python for the backend and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) for the frontend. The system allows for automatic attendance tracking by recognizing faces captured through a camera.

## Features

🔍 **Face Detection**: Detects faces in images or live video streams using computer vision techniques.

🔄 **Face Recognition**: Recognizes faces by comparing them to a pre-trained set of known faces.

📊 **Attendance Tracking**: Automatically tracks attendance based on recognized faces and stores it in a database.

🔒 **Security**: Ensures secure access to the system through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Used for the backend server and face recognition algorithms.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing attendance records.
- **Express.js**: A Node.js web application framework used for building the backend API.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library used for building the frontend user interface.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for running the backend server.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9
- Node.js
- MongoDB

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhishek058/face-recognition-attendance-system.git
2. Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd face-recognition-attendance-system/backend
    npm install
3. Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    Copy code
    cd ../frontend
    npm install

4. Start the backend server:

    ```bash
    Copy code
    npm start

5. Start the frontend development server:

    ```bash
    Copy code
    npm start

Access the application at http://localhost:5173.

Usage
Register new users in the system with their names and images.
Capture faces through a camera for attendance tracking.
The system will automatically recognize and mark the attendance of registered users.
View attendance records and manage users through the frontend interface.
